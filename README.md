# acm.bl
An Acme Management Business Layer repository that cover the fundamentals and guidance to building a Business System requirements and turn it into code using OOP pillars and principals.

Acme Management Business Layer:
This repos is built using OOP pillars: it covers:

#Identifying Class => Represents business entities, Definition of properties(data), Definition of methods(actions/behavior)
#Analization of class created and separation of responsibilities => Minimizes coupling(Making sure each class has single purpose), Maximaze cohesion(Reviewing each method and property of each classs), Simplifies maitenance, Improves testability
#Establishing relationships => Definition of how objects work together to perform the operation of the applicatio
#Leverage reuse => Invloves extacting commonality, Building reusable classes/Components, Defining Interfaces

Four pillars or caracteristics of OOP
 
 ###################
1)Abstraction = Description of an entity in single terms, ignoring the irrelavant details, focusing on what is important of a purpose of the specific application
2)Encapsulation = Hiding the datas and the implimentation within a class. The data is stored in the backing field and allowed to be access through the properties getter and setter; The code is accessed through the classes and Interface
3)Inheritance = This allows to reuse code in a parent classes to reuse functionality.
4)Polymophism = The ability of objects of different types to provide a unique interface for different implementations of methods. It is usually used in the context of late binding, where the behavior of an object to respond to a call to its method members is determined based on object type at run time.

The next move might be great giving the following approach a try:
#Clean Code
#Defensive Coding
#Interative Agile
#API
#Design Patterns
#Domain Driven Design
#.Net app...
#C# Best Practices: Improving on the basics or C# Best practices: Collections and Generic.
